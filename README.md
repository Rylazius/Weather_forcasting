# Weather Forecast Project

This repository contains a small data-science project for exploring and forecasting weather using the provided historical dataset. The project includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and modeling, plus supporting data and generated charts.

## What this project is about

- Goal: explore historical weather observations and build forecasting models (regression/classification) to predict future weather-related variables.
- Contents:
	- `data/weatherHistory.csv` — historical weather dataset used in the notebooks.
	- `notebooks/` — three notebooks:
		- `Data_Analysis.ipynb` — exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
		- `Data_Visualization.ipynb` — charts and visual exploration.
		- `Modeling.ipynb` — feature engineering and model experiments.
	- `charts/` — output charts generated by the notebooks.
	- `app.py` — (no entrypoint defined currently) placeholder for app/script to run models or serve predictions.

# Weather Forecast Project

A small data-science repository for exploring historical weather observations and building simple forecasting models. This README is written for a team: it contains a quickstart that gets contributors up and running, plus contribution and PR workflow notes suitable for a GitHub repo.

Status
------

- Notebooks for exploration and modeling: ready-to-run (see `notebooks/`).
- Dataset: `data/weatherHistory.csv` (included).
- `app.py`: currently a placeholder — no production service yet.

Repository layout
-----------------

- `data/` — dataset(s), including `weatherHistory.csv`.
- `notebooks/` — analysis and modeling notebooks:
  - `Data_Analysis.ipynb`
  - `Data_Visualization.ipynb`
  - `Modeling.ipynb`
- `charts/` — generated charts saved by the notebooks.
 - `app.py` — placeholder for future CLI or serving code.
 - `requirements.txt` — pinned Python dependencies.

Quickstart (developer)
-----------------------

Follow these steps to get a local development environment ready. Commands assume a POSIX shell (macOS/Linux, or Git Bash on Windows). Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell equivalents are noted where different.

1) Clone the repo (if not already done)

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd weather_forcast_project
```

2) Create a virtual environment and activate it

macOS / Linux (bash or zsh)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
python -m venv .venv
\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3) Install dependencies

This repo contains a pinned dependency file named `requirements.txt`. To install the packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Launch JupyterLab and open the notebooks(or you can run it by choosing virtual python environment)

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder and run cells top-to-bottom.

Running code / automation
-------------------------

- There is no runnable application shipped yet. If you want a repeatable training or evaluation script, we should add a `scripts/` folder with small Python scripts (for example `scripts/train_baseline.py`) and a `Makefile` or `pyproject.toml` task to run them.

Contributing (team guidelines)
------------------------------

We expect team members to follow a lightweight GitHub workflow:

1. Create feature branches from `main` using the naming convention `feature/<short-desc>` or `fix/<short-desc>`.
2. Keep changes small and focused: one idea per branch.
3. Add or update a notebook and include a short note in the notebook metadata or the PR description describing what changed and why.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting `main` and include:
   - A short summary of the change
   - Steps to reproduce locally (if applicable)
   - Any environment or dependency changes
5. Request one approving review from another team member before merging.

Recommended branch protection rules for `main` (set in the GitHub repo settings):

- Require PR reviews before merging (1 approval)
- Require passing CI (if/when CI is added)
- Enforce linear history (optional)

Code style and notebooks
------------------------

- Keep notebooks runnable top-to-bottom; avoid relying on hidden state.
- When possible, extract reusable code from notebooks into Python modules (e.g., `src/` or `weather/`) and import those modules in notebooks. This makes unit testing and CI easier.

Issues and tasks
----------------

- Open GitHub Issues for bugs, dataset additions, or feature requests.
- Use labels (example: `bug`, `enhancement`, `data`, `help wanted`) to triage work.

Maintainers / contacts
----------------------

- Primary maintainer: add the GitHub username(s) or email(s) here (edit this file).
- For urgent issues, mention @team or use your team's communication channel.

Notes, known quirks and TODOs
----------------------------

- Dependency file is named `requirements.txt`.
- `app.py` is an empty placeholder. We can add a minimal runner or CLI that trains a baseline model and writes outputs to `charts/` and `models/`.
- Consider adding:
  - a `Makefile` or `nox`/`tox` configuration for reproducible dev tasks,
  - a `requirements-dev.txt` for linting/testing tools,
  - CI (GitHub Actions) to run notebooks (or tests) on PRs.

License
-------

Add a license (for example MIT) if this repository will be public. If you tell me which license to use I can add it.

Getting help
------------

If you need assistance setting up the environment or would like me to:

- rename the requirements file,
- add a runnable `app.py` or `scripts/train_baseline.py`, or
- create a small GitHub Actions workflow to run notebooks on PRs,

tell me which task you prefer and I will implement it.
